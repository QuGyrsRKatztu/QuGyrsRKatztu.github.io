## Details
Each of the 20 cards in a set of **Postal Scores** sets up different scenarios. A card's
sender, a card's recipient, or a combination of the
two can carry out the scenario. Participating creates
a shared experience transcending the physical distance between the participants.

Participants have the
opportunity to reflect on how these actions enhance
their postal relationship. How do the actions affect a
sender’s mindset? How do the actions affect a
recipient’s mindset or experience? What might
change for an onlooker? This set of **Postal Scores** postcards is about the postal experience
shared by the users, not just about the text, the fact
that someone is thinking of you, or an image.
